Here is the high level design

content is divided in following topics

1)subsystem.dita
2)creating_subsystem.dita
3)creating_subsystems_by_adding_subsystem_blocks.dita
4)creating_a_subsystem_by_grouping_existing_blocks.dita
5)conditionally_executed_subsystem.dita
6)conditional_execution_behavior.dita

Notes:

1) Subsystem does not specify the why part of the user experience. 
2) I found that few of the labels were missing in the figures. I've edited the same and included in the document
3) Currently "conditionally_executed_subsystem.dita" topic is considered as single concept topic and there is no granular demartion made for various others conditionally executed subsystems (assuming granular subsystems are not violating information reuse principle)
4) In few of the topics, a detailed references may provide additional sense for the users

Topic map information Architecture Assumption:
Currently the content is published with a single map.It is assumed that audience is B2B and therefore, the content is not structed in Q&A (how to user guide) format. If the audience is different (B2C, more non technical folks), then the content might needs to be delivered in different fashion.
