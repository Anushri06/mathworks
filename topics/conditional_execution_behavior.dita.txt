<conbody>

	<p>To speed the simulation of a model, by default the SimulinkÂ® software avoids unnecessary execution of blocks connected to switch, multiport switch, and of conditionally executed blocks. 
	This behavior is conditional execution (CE) behavior. 
	You can disable this behavior for all switch and multiport switch blocks in a model, or for specific conditional subsystems.</p>
